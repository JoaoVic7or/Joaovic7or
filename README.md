# <p align="center"> Hey! </p>

### About Me
I'm a full stack developer with 1.5 years of experience in building robust and scalable applications. <br/> 
My expertise includes working with C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Oracle Database, and JavaScript to deliver effective and high-quality solutions.

I am currently expanding my skillset by learning Swift, diving into iOS development to broaden my horizons. 

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects, sharing knowledge, or simply having a chat about technology and development. <br/>
If you'd like to discuss an opportunity, get advice, or just say hello, <b>feel free to reach out</b>!
